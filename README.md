# Mailjet App

A mobile app for your Mailjet account. 

Here is what you can do with it so far: 

- [x] List your campaigns (with subject, from, to, status such as draft, scheduled or sent)
- [ ] See campaign content
- [ ] Send a draft campaign
- [x] List your transactional messages sent (with subject, from, to, status such as opened, clicked or blocked)
- [x] List you contact lists (name, subscribers)
- [x] See details for a contact list (total emails sent to that list, list statistics...)
- [x] See the list of contacts belonging a given list
- [ ] Add a contact in a list

*Disclaimer: While I do work at Mailjet, this app is a personal project and not an official app.*
