- [x] See campaign content
- [ ] Send a draft campaign
- [x] List your transactional messages sent (with subject, from, to, status such as opened, clicked or blocked)
- [x] List you contact lists (name, subscribers)
- [x] See details for a contact list (total emails sent to that list, list statistics...)
- [x] See contacts in a given list
